        <h2>Problem/Data Domain</h2>
        <p>
            For our general topic we will be looking at how we can improve the interactive system for music-based web applications. There are various client-side feature-related problems that can impact user experience. Some challenges that these music-based web applications like Spotify, Apple Music, and Soundcloud face are customization limitations, personalization and recommendations, and social features. This is due to making these music applications more engaging, user-friendly, and customizable to individual preferences, providing a comprehensive music experience for users. Addressing these client-side features requires ongoing development and testing efforts and prioritizing user feedback in order to release updates that resolve these issues and improve usability. 
        </p>
        <p>
            However, not all of these problems can be addressed as there are still some limitations and loose ends that these applications still have. Mainly pertaining to user usability and customization, other web-based music applications like Spotify and Apple music can have irrelevant music recommendations which can cause the user to receive poor suggestions which can lead to user dissatisfaction. For our application our goal is for our users to have full control over their customizations and preferences so that they are able to truly utilize certain features that are accustomed to their own personalization.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <p>
            The users of this application are most people interested in music and especially with this app, university students. This application gears toward all ages as there is a variety of music available that is appropriate for everyone. Some impacts this application may have on minority groups is that since it is free to sign up it gives these groups access to other cultures and their art. It also provides representation for a variety of historically marginalized communities.

            With the web applications, users will create playlists of music they enjoy listening too. Along with that, users can rate all songs on a 1â€“5-star scale as well as playlists. This improves the user experience as you can see what songs are popularly liked. This can help new listeners discover songs and genres they enjoy. Another added feature is popular songs in your university. Upon signing up, if you are a university student you are asked to put down what university. By doing this we can collect data from everyone in the same university and display the most popular music for that university. This would be interesting for users to view to know a vibe of a university or to know the different songs people around you are listening to. This app will help solve the problems of it being a more social platform as well as more user friendly. A music app where you are free to choose anything is very stressful and people can be overwhelmed. Starting off with the top picks of people around you or seeing reviews on music can start you off to find the music you love.
